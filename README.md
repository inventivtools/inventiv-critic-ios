# Inventiv Critic iOS Library

Use this library to add [Inventiv Critic](https://inventiv.io/critic/) to your iOS app.

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

1. Add the Critic pod to your `Podfile`.
```ruby
pod 'Critic'
```
2. Find your Product Access Token in the [Critic Web Portal](https://critic.inventiv.io/products) by viewing your Product's details.
3. Initialize Critic by starting it from your `AppDelegate`.
```swift
// Swift
Critic.instance().start("YOUR_PRODUCT_ACCESS_TOKEN")
```

```objective-c
// Objective-C
[[Critic instance] start:@"YOUR_PRODUCT_ACCESS_TOKEN"];
```
### Configuration

#### Shake to Send Feedback Report
By default, Critic will prompt your users for feedback when they shake their device. You can disable this if desired.
```swift
// Swift
Critic.instance().preventShakeDetection()
```

```objective-c
// Objective-C
[[Critic instance] preventShakeDetection];
```

#### Log Capture

By default, devices that are not connected to a debug session will pipe console output (`stderr` and `stdout`) to a log file, which is 
included with submitted Reports. You can disable this behavior prior to starting Critic.
```swift
// Swift
Critic.instance().preventLogCapture()
```

```objective-c
// Objective-C
[[Critic instance] preventLogCapture];
```

If you are running a simulator and want to capture logs from the console, you can explicitly start log capture yourself.
```swift
// Swift
Critic.instance().startLogCapture()
```

```objective-c
// Objective-C
[[Critic instance] startLogCapture];
```

## Sending Customer Feedback Reports

You can show the default feedback report screen any time you like by calling the following method from a `UIViewController`.
```swift
// Swift
Critic.instance().showDefaultFeedbackScreen(self)
```

```objective-c
// Objective-C
[[Critic instance] showDefaultFeedbackScreen:self];
```

### Change Text on Default Feedback Screens.

The text shown on the default feedback report screen and the shake detection dialog can be customized to your liking.
```swift
// Swift
Critic.instance().setDefaultShakeNotificationTitle("Easy, easy!")
Critic.instance().setDefaultShakeNotificationMessage("Do you want to send us feedback?")

Critic.instance().setDefaultFeedbackScreenTitle("Submit Feedback")
Critic.instance().setDefaultFeedbackScreenDescriptionPlaceholder("What's happening?\n\nPlease describe your problem or suggestion in as much detail as possible. Thank you for helping us out! ðŸ™‚");
```

```objective-c
// Objective-C
[[Critic instance] setDefaultShakeNotificationTitle:@"Easy, easy!"];
[[Critic instance] setDefaultShakeNotificationMessage:@"Do you want to send us feedback?"];

[[Critic instance] setDefaultFeedbackScreenTitle:@"Submit Feedback"];
[[Critic instance] setDefaultFeedbackScreenDescriptionPlaceholder:@"What's happening?\n\nPlease describe your problem or suggestion in as much detail as possible. Thank you for helping us out! ðŸ™‚"];
``` 

### Sending Product-Specific Metadata with Reports

You can add product-specific metadata through adding entries to the `Critic.instance().productMetadata` dictionary.
```swift
// Swift
Critic.instance().productMetadata["email"] = "test@example.com"
```

```objective-c
// Objective-C
[[[Critic instance] productMetadata] setObject:@"test@example.com" forKey:@"email"];
```

### Sending Device-Specific Metadata

You can add device-specific metadata through adding entries to the `Critic.instance().deviceMetadata` dictionary.
```swift
// Swift
Critic.instance().deviceMetadata["device_uuid"] = "abc123"
```

```objective-c
// Objective-C
[[[Critic instance] deviceMetadata] setObject:@"abc123" forKey:@"device_uuid"];
```

Be sure to set your metadata values prior to calling `Critic.instance().start()` if you wish to include the metadata with every device ping.
Metdata added after starting will only be added to bug report submissions.

## Customizing Feedback Reports

Use the `NVCReportCreator` to build your own reports for custom user experiences or other use cases. Perform `NVCReportCreator` work on a background thread.
```swift
// Swift
let reportCreator = NVCReportCreator()
reportCreator.description = "This is user-entered text about the idea or experience they wish to report."
reportCreator.metadata["Whatever key you want"] = "Whatever value you want"
reportCreator.attachmentFilePaths.add("/absolute/path/to/desired/file.txt")
reportCreator.create({(success: Bool, error: Error?) in
    if success {
        NSLog("Feedback has been submitted!")
    }
    else {
        NSLog("Feedback submission failed.")
    }
})
```

```objective-c
// Objective-C
NVCReportCreator *reportCreator = [NVCReportCreator new];
reportCreator.description = @"This is user-entered text about the idea or experience they wish to report.";
[report.metadata setObject:@"Whatever value you like" forKey:@"Whatever key you want"];
[report.attachmentFilePaths addObject:@"/absolute/path/to/desired/file.txt"];
[reportCreator create:^(BOOL success, NSError *error){
    if(success){
        NSLog(@"Feedback has been submitted!");
    } else {
        NSLog(@"Feedback submission failed.");
    }
}];
```

## Viewing Feedback Reports
Visit the [Critic web portal](https://critic.inventiv.io/) to view submitted reports. Below is some of the device and app-specific information included with every iOS report.
